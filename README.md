# Description of the project 
For this project, I developed my personal web portfolio. Initially conceptualized during my User Experience Design course, I transitioned to coding it independently. Throughout the process, I received invaluable support from my teachers, for which I'm immensely grateful.

While tackling this endeavor, I encountered numerous obstacles. Beginning the project was daunting; the sheer volume of tasks overwhelmed me, leading to confusion about where to start. Additionally, I grappled with organizing elements and determining appropriate sizes.

# the Lessons that i  leared
This project served as an invaluable learning experience. I gained proficiency in utilizing Bootstrap and honed my design skills. While I thoroughly enjoyed the design aspect, I found coding to be the most challenging. Consequently, I've realized that my passion lies primarily in User Experience Design.
